      <description>Not so long ago I gave a presentation about Scala and ScalaTest to my co-workers. This was just basics as I wanted to give them a good and solid base for future researching this language. As it turned out - I probably learned a lot more than they did from this :)
Whenever there is Scala mentioned there also is the phrase pattern matching. Of course Scala does support pattern matching but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how much fun one can have with this.</description>
