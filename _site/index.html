        <p>Java 8 sure did bring a few interesting features. One of them are definitely the streams. Internet is
full of the instructions on how to create and use them. Today I’d like to talk about something a
little bit different - collectors.</p>

        <p>When you begin to learn functional programming everybody is telling you that pure functions with no
side effects are the only way to go. This is fine up to the point. Sooner or later you will hear
about monads. This post tries to explain what the monad is and why you should use it.</p>

        <p>Scala, as a functional language, treats functions as first class citizens. Of course it’s also
object oriented language. Those two paradigms can be seen as conflicting with each other. In this
post I’d like to show you some different ways of creating a functions in Scala to show that these
two worlds can coexist.</p>

        <p>What is cake pattern?
What it’s not?
 - It solves the same problem that dependency injection does.
   The difference is that DI CAN do a bit more. But is it needed?</p>

        <p>Recently I’ve been a part of self-educating team. My workmates and I decided to learn Java 8
features so we could use it at work. Each of us have one or two topics to cover and we had to teach
each other about the cool new features like streams or better type inference. My part was to
cover the <code>Optional</code> class, and today I’d like to show and explain how and why you should use it.</p>
