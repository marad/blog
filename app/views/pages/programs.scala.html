        I've created tons of programs during my coding adventures. Unfortunately most of them
        wasn't finished or wasn't good enough to show it. In this section I'd like to present
        only a few of my programs.

    <h3>This blog!</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            I've used other blogging systems, but I didn't like them. Limitations were to big!
            So I've created my own blog with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGi6Q1pNbS0">blackjack and hookers</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Used technologies:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://slick.typesafe.com/">Slick</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.playframework.com/">Play Framework</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS/CSS</a></li>
            <li>Of course HTML &amp; JavaScript</li>

    </a>
    <div>
        Little program that I made to create Windows manifest files and embedding them in the
        executable files. I used it only to make my C++ Builder programs look less like Windows 98
        in Windows XP and newer.

    </a>
    <div>
        Simple graphics editor to create small 2D game sprites. It was designed so it handles
        multiple layers, transparency and real big zoom in. It's basically a little more advanced
        Paint :)

            I'm lazy. Even with games! I've created this tool to aid my playing the <em>Ultima Online</em> game.
            With this tool you can write a little scripts to make the repeating tasks bearable. It simply sends
            keystrokes and mouse clicks to the UO game window. I've added variables and delay support and that
            all I needed at that time.
        </p>
        <p>
            At that time there already was <a href="http://www.easyuo.com/" target="about:blank">EasyUO</a>.
            Unfortunately it didn't work with the old game client that was required on the server I was playing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scripting language wasn't very elastic. It was somewhat reminiscent to Assembler and PHP combined :)

            I was in High School. The time table was available online. Before leaving to school I normally
            opened a browser and navigate to the page with the time table to check the books I had to take with me.
            I figured that a very simple program to load time table for my class at startup would be very nice
            (browsers start soo loong). In just a few lines of code I was able to make my life better :)

        <p>
            In high scool I've played <a href="http://pl.ogame.gameforge.com/">OGame</a> with my friends.
            Some tasks and calculations were repeatable. This tool was to help me quickly compute the amount
            of transporters to use when I wanted to transport the resources to another planet to build or
            research something there.
        </p>
        <p>
            It only worked with Polish OGame and now it doesn't work at all because of the GUI changes.

            Creates a list of files and directories in given directory. You can also filter the file extensions
            you want to have on the list. I guess I needed something like that at some point in my life :)

            This program was created as a GUI to Borlands <em>coff2omf</em> tool. It converted
            the library files from Microsoft's COFF format to Borlands OMF format.

            My sister asked me to write the program to compute a simple algorithm from her numerology book.
            As it turned out - it was much more rewriting text from the book than actual coding.

            This programs only purpose is to hold informations about colors. It might be useful
            to create customised color palette to use across your system. I personally used it
            with my Sprite Editor which is listed above.
