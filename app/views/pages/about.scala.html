        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <div>
            I like to do a lot of things, but the most fun for me are two below:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>programming</em> - I've started programming with C++ in 2002. Back then I was
                    super excited about making games. Now, few years later - I'm still super excited
                    about making games! Now I'm a Java developer. I do mostly webapp backends. For my
                    personal projects I've tried a lot of programming languages. The one that keeps
                    comming back is Scala. I'm using it for most of my non-work programming.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>playing the guitar</em> - since I was a kid I wanted to play the guitar
                    so my parents got me one. I've played in a few bands but playing concerts is not
                    my best way of spending time. I'd rather play just with my friends in the garage.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Programming languages/Technologies</h3>
        <div>
            As mentioned above I like learning various programming languages. I've tried very hard to
            like the dynamically typed languages like Python and JavaScript. They are fun to play with
            because it's very easy to quickly make simple tools. Unfortunately this does not work
            very well when creating something bigger then BMI calculator... On the other hand static
            typing seemed too verbose. This was before I discovered Scala :)
        </div>
        <div>Below I listed my favourite languages/technologies/whatever:</div>
        <div>
           <ul>
               <li>Scala - this blog is written in Scala</li>
               <li>Java - I'm working with it professionally since 2012</li>
               <li>C/C++</li>
               <li>SQL</li>
               <li>HTML</li>
               <li>CSS</li>
               <li>Python</li>
               <li>JavaScript</li>
               <li>Assembler - mostly basics</li>
           </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
