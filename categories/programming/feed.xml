      <description>Not so long ago I gave a presentation about Scala and ScalaTest to my co-workers. This was just basics as I wanted to give them a good and solid base for future researching this language. As it turned out - I probably learned a lot more than they did from this :)
Whenever there is Scala mentioned there also is the phrase pattern matching. Of course Scala does support pattern matching but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how much fun one can have with this.</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been creating entity component framework which I named Scalartemis. Name is direct descendant of two words. First (surprisingly) is Scala - the language it&amp;rsquo;s written in. Second is Artemis.
Artemis is entity component framework that I wanted to port to Scala. During the process of porting I started to change things a bit to achieve better performance/api/usability. At some point I decided that this is pointless and I should start from scratch using the knowledge I&amp;rsquo;ve gained.</description>
